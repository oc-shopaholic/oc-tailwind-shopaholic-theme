# US-09:  Log Out
### As an Authenticated User I can Log out from the Shop so that I can not leave my account logged in when I don’t need it.


#### **Acceptance criteria:**

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1.</td>
        <td>I can press the “LOG OUT” hyperlink.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2.</td>
        <td>I can see the “Are you sure?” message.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3.</td>
        <td>I can confirm my desire to Log out.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4.</td>
        <td>I can see the “Main” page with the “LOG IN” and “SIGN UP” hyperlinks.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### **Negative scenario:**

<table>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">I decided not to log out.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3A.</td>
        <td>I do not confirm my desire to Log out.</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4A.</td>
        <td>I don’t see the “Are you sure?” message.</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
