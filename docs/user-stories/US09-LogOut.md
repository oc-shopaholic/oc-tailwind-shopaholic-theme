# US-09:  Log Out
### As an Authenticated User I can Log out from the Shop so that I can not leave my account logged in when I donâ€™t need it.


#### **Acceptance criteria:**

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1.</td>
        <td>I can press the "log out" hyperlink.</td>
    </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>2.</td>
        <td>I can see the the "log in" and "sign up" hyperlinks on the header.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### **Negative scenario:**

<table>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">I didn't clicked on "Remember me" checkbox when I was signing in.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1A.</td>
        <td>I can Log out by just closing the window with the System.</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
